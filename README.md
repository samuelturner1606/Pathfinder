# Computer Programming Project 	
## University of Bristol, Dec 2018 – Jan 2019
*	Individual assignment to showcase Python skills learned from the Introduction to Computer programming unit
*	Created a game environment that contained; a user-controlled player, an enemy that paths towards the player whilst avoiding obstacles that the player can draw on the screen 
*	Coded from scratch a pathfinding algorithm, inspired by Dijkstra’s algorithm, that was designed to handle multiple end points (e.g. players) and the ability to find the shortest path even through portal mechanics 
*	Used prior mathematical knowledge to code mechanics such as player movement using the equations of motion in vector form and using vectors to detect collisions between the game objects
*	Demonstrated higher level understanding and good programming practises such as through; object orientated programming (classes and class inheritance), standard naming conventions for variables, using a variety of data structures and data types
*	Assignment feedback - “Original take on an avoidance game, good understanding of more complex ideas in Python, good code structure by using classes, implemented interesting mechanics into PyGame such as wall drawing and pathfinding.”
